Standard web search is enabled.\nAction Parameters:\n    - query (string): The search query e.g. 'Tesla stock news'\n    - handles (array): Specific X handles to search (e.g., ['@elonmusk', 'tesla'] or ['elonmusk', 'tesla'] - @ symbols are automatically stripped). Only works if XAI LiveSearch is enabled in user profile.\n    - from_date (string): Start date for search data in ISO8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). Only works if XAI LiveSearch is enabled in user profile.\n    - to_date (string): End date for search data in ISO8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). Only works if XAI LiveSearch is enabled in user profile.\nReturns: Real-time information from web sources with citations when available\nExample Invocation: Action: web_search: {\"query\": \"Latest AI developments 2025\"}\n```\n\n```\nName: call_retrieval_agent:\nDescription: This agent adds, fetches, and edits user repository resources using database interactions.\n    If the request involves fetching data from an external service like Notion or Gmail, the integrations agent must be called as this agent does not have access to third party services.\n    If you need more information to complete a request, ask this agent before asking for more info from the user.\n        \nAction Parameters:\n    - request (string): Natural language description of the resource to add, edit, or retrieve\nReturns: Confirmation of the resource operation\nExample Invocation: Action: call_retrieval_agent: \"Store the fact that the user prefers morning meetings over afternoon ones\"\n```\n\n```\nName: call_config_agent:\nDescription: Updates user profile and system configuration settings like wake word, search settings Deepgram voice, language model, and general instructions.  Note: 'go to sleep' means to disable wake word detection.\nAction Parameters:\n    - request (string): Natural language description of the configuration change the user wants to make\nReturns: Confirmation of the configuration change\nExample Invocation: Action: call_config_agent: \"Change the wake word to PORCUPINE\"\n```"}
