Donor site morbidity refers to complications or functional deficits occurring at the site where the graft is harvested or taken from, which in the case of Achilles tendon grafts can include pain, weakness, or tendonitis.\\n\\nIn hip surgery involving rectus femoris repair, Achilles tendon allografts may be chosen when autograft options are unsuitable, but this is relatively rare and not well documented in large studies. The risk of **bilateral Achilles tendonitis** or other tendon problems after using an Achilles allograft for hip surgery is not well established in the literature, but potential risk factors for tendonitis generally include overuse, biomechanical imbalances, smoking (which impairs healing), and systemic factors such as inflammation or infection[1][2][5].\\n\\nKey points regarding Achilles tendon allograft use and related risks:\\n\\n- **Donor site morbidity**: Achilles tendon autografts carry a risk of donor site complications such as pain and functional impairment, which is why allografts (from donors) are sometimes preferred to avoid these issues, though allografts have their own risks like immune response and slower integration[2].\\n\\n- **Postoperative complications**: Infection and healing problems are significant concerns after tendon graft surgeries, including those involving the Achilles tendon[3].\\n\\n- **Bilateral tendonitis risk factors**: Tendonitis in both Achilles tendons after surgery could be influenced by systemic factors (e.g., smoking, inflammation), mechanical overload, or altered gait mechanics post-surgery[1][5].\\n\\n- **Use in hip surgery**: While Achilles tendon allografts can be used for rectus femoris or other hip tendon repairs, this is less common than in knee ligament reconstructions, and detailed data on outcomes and complications specific to hip surgery are limited[2].\\n\\nIn summary, Achilles tendon allografts may be used in hip surgeries like rectus femoris repair but carry risks related to donor site morbidity and postoperative complications. Bilateral Achilles tendonitis after such surgery could be influenced by multiple risk factors including systemic health, mechanical stress, and healing capacity. Careful patient selection and postoperative management are essential to minimize these risks.\",\n  \"model\": \"sonar\",\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 52,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 503,\n    \"total_tokens\": 555,\n    \"search_context_size\": \"low\",\n    \"cost\": {\n      \"input_tokens_cost\": 0.0,\n      \"output_tokens_cost\": 0.001,\n      \"request_cost\": 0.005,\n      \"total_cost\": 0.006\n    }\n  },\n  \"citations\": [\n    \"https://roh.nhs.uk/services-information/foot-and-ankle/triple-fusion\",\n    \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12413931/\",\n    \"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/24730114251363880\",\n    \"https://mskdoctors.com/acl-reconstruction-autograft-allograft-regenten/\",\n    \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12421139/\"\n  ],\n  \"images\": [],\n  \"related_questions\": []\n}","model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","action_name":null,"action_params":null,"metadata":"{}","created_at":"2025-09-22 23:23:25.234376+00"},{"idx":2,"id":"157cdb25-52b8-4575-a42d-cde5a7d75407","request_id":"web-1758583337366-1u6n5zlg7","user_id":"56a2c117-6486-4ca5-a57d-6c2e877e7083","type":"thought","turn":6,"agent_name":"Wellness Agent","content":"Now I have comprehensive information about the user's surgical history and the potential connections to their current bilateral Achilles tendonitis.

Despite the morning pain, I attended the Founders Run Club event that day, intending to mid-foot strike and take it easy, but wasn't able to maintain that form during the run.

Changes such as reduced hip flexion or knee extension during walking can cause compensatory movements elsewhere in the kinetic chain, including the ankle and foot. These compensations may increase stress on the Achilles tendon, predisposing it to tendinitis.\\n\\nKey biomechanical connections and compensation patterns include:\\n\\n- **Altered hip and knee mechanics:** Post-rectus femoris repair, patients often exhibit reduced hip flexion and knee extension during gait, sometimes manifesting as a \\\"stiff-knee gait.\\\" This can reduce foot clearance and cause compensatory hip hiking or circumduction to clear the foot during swing phase[3]. Such altered mechanics shift load and timing patterns down the chain.\\n\\n- **Kinetic chain compensation:** Impaired hip function can lead to abnormal ankle mechanics. For example, reduced hip extension or flexion can increase anterior pelvic tilt and alter ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion moments, affecting Achilles tendon loading[5]. Compensation at the ankle may increase strain on the Achilles tendon, contributing to tendinitis.\\n\\n- **Muscle force redistribution:** The quadriceps, including rectus femoris, exert significant forces during gait. After surgery, altered muscle activation patterns may increase reliance on other muscles, including calf muscles that load the Achilles tendon more heavily[1].\\n\\n- **Proprioceptive and neuromuscular changes:** Injury and surgery can disrupt proprioceptive input and muscle coordination along the kinetic chain, leading to instability and maladaptive movement patterns that increase Achilles tendon stress[2].\\n\\n- **Rehabilitation implications:** Proper rehab focusing on restoring hip strength, flexibility, and normal gait mechanics is crucial to prevent downstream compensations that can cause Achilles tendonitis. Progressive loading and neuromuscular training can help normalize kinetic chain function[2].\\n\\nIn summary, hip surgery with rectus femoris repair can disrupt normal gait biomechanics, leading to compensatory patterns that increase Achilles tendon loading and risk of tendinitis. This reflects the interconnected nature of the lower limb kinetic chain, where dysfunction at the hip can propagate to the ankle and foot. Addressing these biomechanical links through targeted rehabilitation is essential to optimize recovery and prevent secondary injuries.\",\n  \"model\": \"sonar\",\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 45,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 504,\n    \"total_tokens\": 549,\n    \"search_context_size\": \"low\",\n    \"cost\": {\n      \"input_tokens_cost\": 0.0,\n      \"output_tokens_cost\": 0.001,\n      \"request_cost\": 0.005,\n      \"total_cost\": 0.006\n    }\n  },\n  \"citations\": [\n    \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12411017/\",\n    \"https://nydnrehab.com/what-we-treat/foot-and-ankle-pain/ankle-instability-and-ankle-sprain-treatment/\",\n    \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12400543/\",\n    \"https://www.cureus.com/articles/410765-the-two-step-test-as-a-practical-discriminator-of-independent-ambulation-one-week-after-total-hip-arthroplasty.pdf?email=\",\n    \"https://londoncartilage.com/the-biomechanics-of-hip-flexion-and-its-role-in-labral-tear-development/\",\n    \"https://www.springermedizin.de/minimally-invasive-anterolateral-approach-versus-direct-anterior/20306088\",\n    \"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-17398-z\",\n    \"https://ekstrandortho.com/hip/\",\n    \"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2025.1641859/pdf\"\n  ],\n  \"images\": [],\n  \"related_questions\": []\n}","model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","action_name":null,"action_params":null,"metadata":"{}","created_at":"2025-09-22 23:23:08.269434+00"},{"idx":16,"id":"c9ad07b1-f618-4bc5-9033-13aa6479339a","request_id":"web-1758583337366-1u6n5zlg7","user_id":"56a2c117-6486-4ca5-a57d-6c2e877e7083","type":"action","turn":0,"agent_name":"Chat Agent","content":"Action: call_wellness_agent","model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","action_name":"call_wellness_agent","action_params":"{\"request\": \"The user has bilateral Achilles tendonitis and wants to understand how their surgical history may contribute to this condition.

The following instructions are designed to take you step-by-step \\nthrough the process and to answer some frequently asked questions.  \\n \\nWhen am I having surgery and where do I go?  \\nYour surgeon's office will provide you with the location, date, and time for your operation. If you do not hear from your surgeon's \\noffice and want to check on the status of your upcoming procedure, please call the surgeon's office and ask to speak with his/her \\npractice assistant.  \\n \\nWill I meet my anesthesiologist before surgery?  \\nYou will not meet the anesthesiologist assigned to take care of you until the day of surgery. However, you will be assessed by one \\nof UCSF's nurse practitioners prior to your operation. For some patients, this assessment will take place over the phone. For other \\npatients, an in-person evaluation will be required in our PREPARE clinic.  \\n \\nWhat do I need to do now?  \\nYou will receive a call from your surgeon\\u2019s office before your surgery to set up either a phone consult or in-person PREPARE clinic \\nappointment. If the phone consult or in-person PREPARE clinic appointment scheduled does not work, you may call the \\nOrthopaedic Institute PREPARE at 415-514-6131 to reschedule. If you do not receive a call from the PREPARE clinic, please call your \\nsurgeon's office to confirm that your operation has been scheduled and that the referral to PREPARE made.  \\n \\nDo I need to have any tests done prior to surgery?  \\nYour surgeon may require laboratory or other diagnostics tests prior to surgery. These are printed in your After Visit Summary from \\nyour surgery clinic visit, and your surgeon may have also given you printed requisition forms.  \\n \\nIf you are seen in-person in the PREPARE Clinic, your tests will be performed during your PREPARE appointment.  \\n \\nIf you are evaluated by phone, a member of the PREPARE team will give you explicit instructions on when and where to have these \\nstudies done.  \\n \\nFor many operations, laboratory tests, EKGs and chest x-rays are not needed.  \\n \\nIf you are a Jehovah's Witness, you must notify your surgeon in advance of your procedure. In addition, you MUST discuss your \\ndesires regarding transfusion of blood products with your surgeon or the Nurse Practitioner from the PREPARE Clinic.  \\nIf you have a bleeding disorder such as von Willebrand's disease or hemophilia, notify your surgeon in advance as special \\narrangements may ","model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","action_name":null,"action_params":null,"metadata":"{}","created_at":"2025-09-22 23:22:41.057305+00"},{"idx":21,"id":"eea3ab0d-7d79-4f6f-8d13-c16050dcf106","request_id":"web-1758583337366-1u6n5zlg7","user_id":"56a2c117-6486-4ca5-a57d-6c2e877e7083","type":"thought","turn":0,"agent_name":"Chat Agent","content":"The user is asking about how their surgical history might contribute to their Achilles tendonitis.
